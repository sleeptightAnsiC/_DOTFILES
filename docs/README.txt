This folder stores recipes and information about how to configurate something,
rather than configuration files itself. Most of those are related to critical
software that requires system-wide configs. You should apply those configs
by hand and you should carefully read what the thing does before using it.

DO NOT TRY TO INJECT FILES FROM THIS FOLDER AUTOMATICALLY!!! ONLY MANUALLY!!!
