# DOTFILES
This repo contains configuration files, scripts and recipes used for working on varius machines and operating systems, but mainly on Linux Arch. \
This is a MIRROR. I only update it when I need to share something about my setup. \
Some files might be a bit raw to read since I change them rapidly on daily basis, \
they're not meant to be easy to understand for everyone, but instead easy to edit for myself.

# notable mentions
- `./scripts/main.bash` sets up my whole system from minimal Arch Instalation. I also use it to keep my machine updated.
- NO desktop enviroment and minimal use of GUIs which results in very small footprint
- unified look across multiple UI toolkits: GTK2, GTK3, QT5, QT6, etc...
- heavily personalized Neovim configuration with support for Language Servers and Debugging
